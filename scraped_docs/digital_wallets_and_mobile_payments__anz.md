## FAQs
### Could I accidentally make a payment or be charged twice with contactless?
No - payments require the amount to be entered first and your card or device held close to the reader. Terminals can only process one transaction at a time, so duplicate payments won’t occur.
### Can I still use my card if the retailer doesn’t have a contactless reader, or if I prefer not to tap?
Yes - just insert or swipe your card and follow the prompts, even for purchases under the contactless limit.
### Do I need to select an account?
No, transactions will be charged to the account linked to your card.
