## Your questions answered
### Cash advances
### What is a cash advance?
A cash advance is a debit to the credit card account that results in you receiving actual cash or a cash equivalent transaction such as the purchase of gambling chips. For example, if you take out cash from an ATM and select ‘credit’ as the account type. It also includes various other types of transactions (for example, where a credit card is used to pay a bill at a bank branch or via an approved agent of the biller i.e. tertiary fees or utility bills). It’s important, however, to note a few key facts about cash advances.
For a full list of transactions that are considered to be a ‘cash advance’, please refer to the ANZ Credit Card Conditions Of Use (PDF) .
### Are there interest free days on a cash advance?
Unlike your purchases, where you could get up to 55 interest-free days or up to 44 interest-free days, you start paying interest from the moment you make the cash advance. Bear in mind that the interest is charged on a daily basis.
A cash advance will always attract interest, regardless of whether you have interest free periods on your Credit Card Account. With cash advances it’s important to know that interest will generally be charged from the date of the cash advance and will continue to be charged on the outstanding cash advances balance until you pay off that transaction balance (including any previously billed interest, fees and charges) in full.
### Is there a limit on cash advance amounts?
A daily limit of $1,000 per credit card applies to cash advances made at an ATM (unless you have made a special arrangement with us to change this limit). Other financial institutions, ATMs, merchants, or service providers may also impose their own minimum amounts or limits.
### Are there any fees on a cash advance?
Yes, a cash advance fee applies to any transaction which is a ‘cash advance’. The fee applies even if your account has a positive balance.
Refer to the ANZ Consumer Credit Cards Fees and Charges (PDF) for information about the fee, and the ANZ Credit Card Conditions of Use (PDF) for information about the transactions that are a ‘cash advance’.
### What is the interest rate on a cash advance?
If you make a credit card cash advance, you may be charged interest at a higher rate than if you made a purchase. You should understand what interest rates apply to your product before making a cash advance.
### What transactions are considered a cash advance?
For a full list of transactions that are considered to be a ‘cash advance’, please refer to the ANZ Credit Card Conditions Of Use (PDF) .
### Interest-free periods
### How does an interest free period work?
We offer credit card accounts with interest free periods on purchases and some credit card accounts without. If you’re unsure whether your account has interest free periods on purchases please refer to your Letter of Offer. You may have noticed how we refer to, for example, 'up to 55-interest free days' on purchases on selected credit cards.
This refers to the maximum possible length of time between the first day of a statement period and the payment due date for that period. For example, if your credit card statement is from June 1 st is to 30 th , your repayment will be due on July 25 th , which is 55 days after the first day of that statement.​
If your credit card account doesn’t have interest free periods on purchases, we will charge interest on the entire outstanding balance on the account (including in respect of any purchases), on a daily basis.
For more information on interest free days, please refer to the ANZ Credit Card Conditions Of Use (PDF) .
### Why didn’t I get 55 interest-free days on my purchase?
If your selected credit card offers up to 55 days interest-free, it does not mean you will get 55 days for every purchase. For example, if your credit card statement is from June 1st is to 30th, your repayment will be due on July 25th, which is 55 days after the first day of that statement.​
Knowing this, you might realise that not all purchases you make get 55 interest-free days. Using the example above, it depends on when that purchase was made during the statement period:
- If you made a purchase on June 1 st , you’ll get the full 55 days before your bill is due.
- If you made a purchase on June 28 th , you’ll have 27 days before your bill is due.
The number of days in a particular statement period will also impact your maximum interest free days (i.e. shorter and longer months).
### How do I manage my credit card to avoid paying interest on purchases?
If your account has interest free periods on purchases, you can avoid paying interest on the purchases balance by always paying the full Closing Balance (or the full Adjusted Closing Balance, if applicable) shown on each statement by the applicable due date. If you don’t pay the full Closing Balance (or the full Adjusted Closing Balance, if applicable) shown on a statement by the applicable due date, you will generally be charged interest on your purchases balance from the day after the Due Date shown on that statement.
### If I don’t currently have Interest Free Days on my account, how can I regain this benefit?
If you don’t currently have the benefit of Interest Free Days on purchases applying to your account and your account is eligible for this benefit you can regain this benefit:
- if you pay the full Closing Balance or the full Adjusted Closing Balance (as applicable) shown on your next (or any subsequent) statement by the Due Date. If you do that we won’t charge interest on your Purchases balance for the period beginning on the day after payment.
- if the Closing Balance or Adjusted Closing Balance shown on a subsequent statement is nil or a positive balance amount. In that case we won’t charge interest on the Purchases balance for the period beginning on the first day of the next statement period.
If you regain your interest free period, your statement may still include interest charged for the period before you regained it.
It also important to be aware that even if you have regained the application of your interest free period we will start charging interest again  if you don’t pay the full Closing Balance or the full Adjusted Closing Balance (as applicable) shown on a statement by the Due Date
See the ANZ Credit Card Conditions of Use (PDF) for more information.
### How can I make full use of my interest-free days?
- Pay the full Closing Balance (or the full Adjusted Closing Balance, if applicable) shown on each statement by the applicable due date.
- Know when your statement periods are.
### Original Credit Transactions
### What is an Original Credit Transaction?
An Original Credit Transaction (OCT) is a credit transaction initiated by a Visa Direct enabled merchant or other person which credits funds to an ANZ Credit Card.
### Is there a limit on Original Credit Transactions?
Effective on and from 24 August 2023, limits will apply to Original Credit Transactions (OCT). The limits are $2,500 per transaction, $9,950 per day and a maximum of 30 transactions per day. These limits will apply to all ANZ Consumer Credit Cards.
