# ATM security
ANZ ATMs come with in-built ATM features to help protect you from security threats like card skimming. There are steps you can take to protect yourself too. Learn about common ATM security threats and how to keep your bank details safe.
EndNoIndex ## What is card skimming
Card skimming is when criminals use devices attached to an ATM to capture data from the magnetic stripe on the back of an ATM card. Criminals put a concealed scanning device over an ATM’s card reader and hide a camera to record your PIN as you enter it.
By skimming someone’s card, a criminal can make unauthorised purchases from your account, using your money. Skimming devices are often well disguised and it can be difficult to notice if an ATM you’re using has been tampered with.
## How do we protect you?
Our ATMs are fitted with a variety of protective measures to better protect customers from card fraud. Our newer ATMs are installed with a device that changes the shape of the card reader, making it hard for anyone to install a skimming device.
Your card will either pass slowly through the reader or jolt as it enters. These are both signs that the ATM you're using has skimming prevention software installed. As the machine ‘shakes’ your card on entry, it interrupts any scanning process and prevents skimming attempts.
We also have other ATM security features, such as ink-staining technology, which helps prevent theft and helps to ensure your information and funds are kept secure.
## How you can protect yourself
Protect your details when using an ATM by staying vigilant and following these essential security tips to help safeguard your information and prevent fraud.
### Memorise your PIN
Ensure your PIN is always secure by keeping it in your memory and never storing it on you or writing it down.
### Cover the keypad
Shield the keypad from prying eyes to keep your PIN confidential.
### Stay aware of others
Be vigilant of your surroundings to prevent others from seeing your PIN.
### Secure your cash
Secure your money immediately in your purse or wallet to avoid attracting unwanted attention.
### Use Tap & PIN
It's a more secure alternative and it reduces skimming opportunities.
## Tap & PIN
Using advanced contactless technology, you can tap your Australian-issued ANZ Visa card at any ANZ ATM to carry out transactions. With Tap & PIN, you'll:
### PIN will still be required
Enjoy peace of mind knowing that your PIN will always be required for security.
### Reduce card skimming risks
Avoid the risk of card skimming as your card doesn't need to be placed in the ATM card reader.
### Safe transactions
Rest easy knowing your transactions are safe and fully encrypted.
### Carry out transactions anywhere
Carry out transactions anywhere you see the contactless symbol.
