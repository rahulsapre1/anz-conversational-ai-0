Good day everyone, it's Dylan Alcott here.
Now I want to share with you a personal story about something that almost happened to me.
It might just save you from falling victim to a scam.
Now, I love my shoe collection, even though I can't walk.
And like many of you, I'm always on the lookout.
Sorry, the lookout for that new edition.
One day when I was younger, I found what seemed to be like a bloody awesome deal online for a rare pair of shoes, and it was at an awesome price.
The website looked legit and there were hundreds of positive reviews.
And just as I was about to click buy, something kind of made me pause.
It seemed too good to be true.
So I did a quick search of the company and it actually turns out they're a fake website designed to steal people's personal information and money.
That day, by just pausing, listening to my gut, doing a bit of research, I kind of saved myself from being scam.
And you know what?

## How to protect yourself this festive season
- Always use an online store or charitable organisation that is reputable and legitimate (consider reviews, time in business, and whether there's a padlock icon next to the URL).
- Avoid clicking links in emails, SMS messages or pop-ups. Access websites directly through your web browser instead. Be cautious when opening eCards, even if they’ve come from someone you know.
- Don’t assume that the first search result on your browser is the real website.
- Don’t rely on the contact details or website address provided in a suspicious call, email, or SMS. Confirm the legitimacy of messages through verifiable numbers.
- Ensure automatic updates on your device are turned on and your anti-virus and anti-spyware software are up to date.
