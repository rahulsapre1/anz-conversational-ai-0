# Important Update: BPAY View Service
Starting 31 May 2025, BPAY View® in ANZ Internet Banking will be phased out in stages. While this change affects how you receive your bills and bill notifications, it won't impact your ability to pay bills using BPAY® in the ANZ App and Internet Banking.
We understand this may change the way you manage your bills, and we're here to support you through the transition.
EndNoIndex ## What to expect:
- From 31 May 2025, it will no longer be possible to register for BPAY View or add new billers in ANZ Internet Banking.
- By the end of September 2025, all active BPAY View arrangements in ANZ Internet Banking will be deactivated. You’ll still be able to view past bills for now but won’t receive new bills through BPAY View. (Note: Some billers may still send a bill via BPAY View for a short period after this date.)
To make the transition easier, we recommend deactivating your BPAY View bills in ANZ Internet Banking before September 2025.
