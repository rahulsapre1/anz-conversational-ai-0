## Report a scam, fraud or suspicious activity to ANZ
It can be hard to spot scams and fraudulent activity. In a genuine ANZ call, SMS message, letter or email, we will never ask you to:
- share sensitive banking details (like passwords, PINs, ANZ Shield codes, token codes, or one-time passcodes for payment).
- click a link to log in to your account
- grant remote access to your computer, phone, tablet (or any other mobile device)
- transfer money to another account
Avoid clicking on any links in emails or SMS messages, even if they appear to be from ANZ. Instead, log in directly through the ANZ App or contact us via an official channel.
