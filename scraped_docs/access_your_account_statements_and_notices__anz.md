## FAQs
### Why can’t I see or open online statements and notices?
If you see the error "This account is not eligible to receive online statements", the reason may be:
- The account is not eligible for online statements and notices.
- You are not eligible to view online statements and notices for this account.
- A temporary system error (in which case we recommend you try again later).
If you can see your online statements and notices but they don’t open correctly in an internet browser window:
- Ensure you have the latest version of Adobe Reader installed.
- Have your pop-up blockers disabled and JavaScript enabled to correctly open your PDF online statements and notices in a new window or tab.
- Try to export the transactions you wish to see.
If you can see your online statements and notices but they don’t open correctly in the ANZ App it may be caused by:

- Your Statement may be too large: we suggest you download it using Internet Banking.
### Can I get online statements and notices for accounts not linked to my ANZ App or Internet Banking?
Your accounts must be linked to your online banking to see online statements and notices. If you are unable to see any of your accounts, please use the link my accounts function on ANZ Internet Banking (this will take 24-48 hours to take effect), or you can Contact us .

### What happens to my online statements and notices if I close all of my accounts?
You will lose access to historical online statements and notices if all accounts linked to the ANZ App or Internet Banking are closed. Before closing your accounts, we suggest you:
- Save electronic copies to your computer or print statements and notices.
- Update your account preference settings to Paper , which will ensure you receive any final statements and notices in the mail.
Note: There must be at least one active account linked to the ANZ App or Internet Banking to view online statements and notices for eligible accounts .
### Can I change how often I receive my statements?
Yes, you can on some account types. Contact us to change the statement frequency.
### How are online statements different to viewing the transaction in the transaction history?
Online transactions display the most current transactions. This transaction record is not an account statement.
Online statements, on the other hand, are scanned copies of paper statements generated periodically (monthly/quarterly/half yearly) and are dependent on the statement end date and other legal requirements.
### How can I tell whose card was used to make a payment?
When viewing your statements, the last four digits of the ANZ credit card number used will appear under Card used. This will help you identify which card was used for a particular transaction.
### What happens to online statements and notices if I lose my credit card?
You should report your lost or stolen credit card immediately by:
- Blocking your card and reporting a lost or stolen card via the ANZ App
- Calling 1800 033 844 (International callers +61 3 8699 6955) 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Your historical account statements and notices for transactions made using the lost/stolen card will still be available to view online in the ANZ App via or Internet Banking. If your original card was lost or stolen, your preference in some instances may default back to Paper. Please check your statement and notice preferences and amend as necessary.
### Why are my online notices not appearing?
As we are in the process of digitising our notices, some notices may not yet be displayed in the ANZ App or Internet Banking. There are also some notice types that will continue to be provided by mail only. When new notice types are digitised, they will be available to view in the ANZ App or Internet Banking by following the steps above.
Some notices will continue to be provided by mail.
### What is the difference between "Processed" and "Transaction” date?
‘Processed’ refers to the date the transaction was processed into your account by ANZ.
‘Transaction Date’ refers to the date the transaction was carried out by the merchant.
Transactions will only appear after the merchant processes them and forwards the details to ANZ for processing.
