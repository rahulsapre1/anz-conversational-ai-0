FAQs
What is PayID?
PayID is like a nickname for your account. It can be your phone number, email address, Australian Business Number (ABN), Australian Company Number (ACN) or organisation ID and is unique to each customer. It doesn’t replace a BSB and account number, which stays exactly the same, but is easier to remember.
Why use PayID?
Fast payments
Pay family, friends or tradies in as little as 60 seconds.

FAQs
Can I have multiple PayIDs?
A PayID can only be registered to one account. However, you can have multiple PayIDs on your profile by creating different types, i.e. one for mobile, one for email. These can be linked to the same account or to different accounts if you prefer.
For example:
You could have both your mobile PayID and your email PayID linked to your ANZ One Offset account, or
You could have your mobile PayID linked to your ANZ One Offset account and your email PayID linked to your ANZ Access Advantage account.
What should I do if I get an error when setting up PayID?
There may be a number of reasons why you are unable to create a PayID. For example, it may be because it is already linked to another bank account at another financial institution. A mobile number, email address or ABN/ACN can only be registered once across all financial institutions in Australia. You’ll need to request a transfer from your other financial institution before you can create it with ANZ.
If you’ve already transferred this PayID from another financial institution, please check with them to ensure that it's been released. Once it’s been successfully released, you’ll need to create your PayID using ANZ Internet Banking or the ANZ App.
My details may have been used by someone else as a PayID - How do I dispute this?
If you believe a PayID has been created in error, you can complete an ownership dispute request and we can look into this for you.
You can raise a dispute query via ANZ Internet Banking or by contacting the ANZ Contact Centre on 13 13 14.
