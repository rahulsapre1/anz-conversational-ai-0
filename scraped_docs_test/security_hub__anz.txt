Security questions
What is cyber security?
Criminals are becoming more sophisticated and are using technology in creative ways to get access to information and funds. That’s why cyber security (protecting things like your computer, phone and personal information) is so important.
Cyber incidents can include the use of malicious software (e.g. malware and viruses) enabled by people or through exploiting vulnerabilities on websites or online services. Cyber incidents can also include malicious attacks on organisations. Typically, these incidents are used to get access to sensitive information, ultimately for financial gain, or to make a political statement.
Explore the steps you can take to
protect yourself
or
your organisation
from cyber incidents.
What is a scam?
Scams can be complex and present in multiple ways. For example, impersonation scams typically involve convincing individuals they’re interacting with a trusted person or organisation (like your bank, tax office or investment company).
In order to steal your money, the criminal may convince you to share sensitive information (e.g. your banking details) or authorise a payment from your account. This fake relationship can be built over a number of months over the phone, SMS messages, email or social media.
Learn more about common types of scams

What is fraud?
Fraud can take many forms and can occur without your knowledge. An example of credit card fraud is when credit card details are stolen using a specialised device, during a legitimate transaction. You may first become aware there’s an issue when you’re notified by your bank or when you view your transaction history.
Find out how we protect our customers using our fraud detection technology,
ANZ Falcon®.
How to report a scam
Reporting a scam is an important step to help stop it. Plus it can prevent countless others falling victim too.

Learn how to spot a scam

What is phishing?
Phishing is a technique used by criminals to gain access to systems or sensitive personal or financial information, like bank account details, by impersonating an individual or business you may recognise and trust. Phishing is often done through legitimate-looking websites, emails and SMS messages, which are actually fake.
I’ve received a message or call from ANZ. How do I know it's genuine?
It can be hard to spot scams and fraudulent activity. In a genuine ANZ call, SMS message or email, we will never ask you to:
share sensitive banking details (like passwords, PINs, ANZ Shield codes, token codes. or one-time passcodes (for payment) in an email or SMS)
click a link to log in to your account
grant remote access to your computer, phone, tablet (or any other mobile device)
transfer money to another account
