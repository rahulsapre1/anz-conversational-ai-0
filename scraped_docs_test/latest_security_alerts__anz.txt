ANZ Rewards SMS Scam
Type:
A scam has been identified where individuals are receiving SMS messages impersonating ANZ Rewards. These messages may claim that rewards points are about to expire and include a link to redeem them.
Be cautious of SMS messages, emails or phone calls, claiming to be from ANZ. They may ask you to log in to your account through a link, provide sensitive banking details, download software, transfer money or open another account.
Remember, we will never ask you to:
share sensitive banking details (like passwords, PINs, ANZ Shield codes, token codes, or one-time passcodes for payment).
click a link to log in to your account.
grant remote access to your computer, phone, tablet (or any other mobile device).
transfer money to another account.
How to help protect yourself?
Be cautious of unexpected emails or SMS messages, or phone calls, and do not click on any links, or open any attachments.
Contact your provider/bank immediately on a listed number if you receive a message from someone saying your account or reward points is at risk, under review, or locked or if you enter personal details into a link that you suspect is a scam.
Do not share personal or financial details, and never provide your passwords, account numbers, or one-time passcodes to anyone.
Always pause and reassess the situation. Scammers often create a sense of urgency, pressuring you to act quickly.

Social media minimum age scams
Type:
From 10 December 2025, some social media platforms will be restricted, by law, to people aged 16 and over.
These laws require affected platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent anyone under 16 from creating or holding accounts.
These measures are designed to protect young people from the risks and pressures associated with social media use.
The National Anti-Scam Centre has warned about four potential scams that opportunistic criminals may use to take advantage of these changes:
Platform impersonation scams
Scammers may pretend to be social media platforms or age verification providers, and ask you to verify your age or risk losing your account.
Government impersonation scams
Scammers may pretend to be from government or law enforcement, claiming you have breached the new laws and threaten fines unless you provide proof of age.
Fake ID scams
Scammers may offer fake IDs or access to age-verified accounts for a fee, targeting young people under 16 and their families.
‘Hi Mum’ scams
Scammers might impersonate young people aged 16 or older, contacting their parents or guardians to claim they need help verifying their age to use a social media platform.
How to help protect yourself?
STOP
. Don’t be rushed to share age verification details quickly. Don’t make any payments. No legitimate platforms are requesting payment associated with these laws.
CHECK
. Make sure the person or organisation you’re dealing with is real. Find out how your social media platforms are communicating with users about the restrictions and how they are verifying users’ ages. You can visit
eSafety's frequently asked questions page
for more information.
PROTECT
. If you’ve given any personal information, such as your age or proof of identity, or money to someone you suspect is a scammer act quickly. The
What to do if you’ve been scammed page
on scamwatch.gov.au has steps you can follow.

Fake government emails
Type:
Scammers are sending extremely convincing fake emails pretending to be from Services Australia and Centrelink. These scams have already hit over 270,000 inboxes nationwide targeting a wide range of organisations including schools, hospitals, law firms, corporations, and even government agencies.
The emails look real and often mention various Australian benefit systems like Superannuation or Family Tax Benefits. These emails are mostly written and sent using various techniques to avoid security or spam filters.
They deceive people into clicking links and entering personal details, which can lead to identity theft, account compromise, or even ransomware attacks.
How to help protect yourself?
Be cautious of unexpected emails or SMS messages, or phone calls, and do not click on any links, or open any attachments.
Contact your provider/bank immediately on a listed number if you receive a message from someone saying your account or reward points is at risk, under review, or locked or if you enter personal details into a link that you suspect is a scam.
Do not share personal or financial details, and never provide your passwords, account numbers, or one-time passcodes to anyone.
Always pause and reassess the situation. Scammers often create a sense of urgency, pressuring you to act quickly.
