It can often be the little things that chip away at your savings.
And while everyday spending is easier than ever, it’s getting harder to keep track of.
That’s why we’ve created Your Money Report. A handy tool designed to help you spot saving opportunities.
Your Money Report provides you with a personalised snapshot of some of the money coming in and going out across your eligible ANZ accounts.
Now, let’s get down to the details.
First up, you’ll see handy highlights of how you spent some of your money in the previous month...
...and how it compares to your average monthly spend over the last 12 months.
You’ll be able to see the percentage difference between your money in and money out...
...so you can think about whether more could be added to your savings.
The money out of your eligible accounts will first be broken down into broad categories like Spending & Transfers, Bills, and Loan Repayments.
After that, you’ll find a breakdown of your spending by category…
...and by merchant.
It could help you decide on where to make tweaks to your spending habits.
Your Money Report also contains a 12 month summary of your spending.
It’ll be broken down just like your monthly summary.
A simple bar chart will show you when your spend was the highest across the last 12 months.
Take a second to work out if this is due to yearly events like birthdays, rego renewal or holidays.
You could get ahead of the game and put some extra funds aside for those months.
So, where can you access Your Money Report?
Simply log in to the ANZ App
Select ‘For you’
Tap on ‘Your Money Report’
You can send Your Money Report to your email and view it in detail on another device.
Get started and get a better perspective of your money.

FAQs
Who is eligible to receive the report and what products/accounts
are included in the report?
Your Money Report is available to ANZ customers who hold eligible ANZ accounts and are registered for the ANZ App or Internet Banking. For a current list of eligible accounts refer to
eligible product list (PDF)
. Further information on understanding accounts within Your Money Report is available on pages 13 to 15 of your report.
A snapshot of some of your transactions for all your eligible accounts will appear in the report.
Your Money Report will not contain any credit card transactions where you are not the credit card account holder, but are an additional cardholder on someone else’s account.
I am an ANZ Plus customer. Are my spend insights featured in Your Money Report?
ANZ Plus products are not included within Your Money Report. As an ANZ Plus customer, the ANZ Plus App has interactive insights into your spend across your ANZ Plus everyday and Save accounts.
I can't see my report, why is that?
You may not see your report in the ANZ App or Internet Banking for multiple reasons:
There may be no transactions made on any eligible account(s) for the relevant time period
You may not hold an eligible account
You only hold an ANZ credit card as an additional cardholder rather than the primary cardholder
Why are some of my transactions incorrectly categorised or showing missing merchant details in Your Money Report, and can I fix them?
You may notice that some transactions are incorrectly categorised or show missing or mismatched merchant names.  In some instances, not all category classifications will match the relevant merchant names, however, this information is constantly reviewed, and we may continue to make improvements over time. In addition, while every effort has been made to provide the correct category there may be some instances where spending has not been categorised and treated as ‘Unclassified’ or falls into an ‘Other expenses’ category.
All merchant information is provided by our third-party supplier, Look Who’s Charging Pty Ltd. In some instances, Look Who's Charging may be unable to match a particular transaction with a merchant.
You can manually re-categorise transactions within the Spend Summary feature of the ANZ App. However, please note that these changes will only apply within the app and will not be reflected in Your Money Report.
We are continually reviewing and improving our categorisation processes to enhance accuracy over time.
Does the report constitute financial advice?
No, the report is not a statement of your financial position nor is it intended to constitute financial advice. The report should not be relied on when making financial decisions, preparing any budget plans nor should it be used to apply for a credit card or other loan products.
I don’t understand how certain transactions have been treated in the report.
What can I do?
The treatment of some specific scenarios have been
explained here
. We encourage this webpage is read together with pages 13 to 15 of your report.
Can I view the report in portrait and landscape orientation on my phone?
The report can only be viewed in portrait orientation at this time. To view the report in landscape orientation you can download your report and email it to yourself to view it on a desktop.
The report is compatible with a screen reader if it's downloaded on your device.
The report's colour scheme is also compliant with the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.
If I close an account, will transactions made using this account still appear on my report from previous months?
Yes, closing an account(s) does not affect reports from previous months as the reports are static.
