PayTo is a fast, simple, and secure way to make payments from your

PayID®
or BSB and account number. Whether it’s for your electricity bill, TV subscription or insurance policies, you can view, authorise, and manage your PayTo agreements easily all in one place within your ANZ digital channel.
FAQs
How does PayTo work?
A merchant (payee) will set up a PayTo Payment Agreement with you. This agreement could be for a one-off, ad-hoc, or recurring payment from your
eligible bank account
, using your BSB and account number or PayID®.
PayTo Payment Agreements will appear in your ANZ banking channel. Once you have reviewed and authorised the agreement, the merchant (payee) can debit your account as agreed.
Can I make changes to a PayTo Agreement?
Yes, you can find your PayTo Payment Agreements in your ANZ banking channel where you can view details, pause, resume, change the linked account or cancel the agreement.
Note: You will only be able to change the linked account or review an updated PayTo agreement from a merchant (payee) via Internet Banking. These services are not available in the ANZ App.
Where will I see PayTo offered as a payment option?
As PayTo starts to become more widely available, you’ll see it in all kinds of places like in-app, ecommerce websites and for utilities.
Keep your eye out for the PayTo logo.
Who owns PayTo?
PayTo is an initiative of Australian Payments Plus (AP+), the organisation that operates Australia’s real-time payments infrastructure, the New Payments Platform (NPP). PayTo is developed by AP+ in collaboration with banks, fintechs and payment services providers.
AP+ is Australia’s domestic payment organisation that also brings together brands such as BPAY and eftpos.
Is PayTo replacing Direct Debit?
Among other uses, PayTo may be used as a digital and more modern alternative to the current direct debit system. Some merchants (payees) will move their direct debits to PayTo, which will give customers more visibility and control over their recurring payments.
Who do I contact for help?
If you have a query about a PayTo Payment Agreement, you should first get in touch with the merchant (payee). If they are not able to resolve your query, please contact ANZ.
For more information, please refer to your product Terms and Conditions.
Does a PayTo payment impact my Pay Anyone Limit?
As a PayTo payment is not a Pay Anyone payment, your daily Pay Anyone limit will not be impacted when a PayTo payment is debited from your account.
Is there a maximum PayTo agreement limit?
Yes, new PayTo agreements or requests to amend an existing PayTo agreement that amount to greater than $25,000 will be automatically rejected. These PayTo agreements will go straight into the Cancelled category.

FAQs
Is it safe to give a merchant (payee) my BSB and account number, or my Pay ID?
As is the case for any other payment agreement, you will need to provide your payment details (BSB and account number or PayID) to the merchant (payee).
A merchant (payee) can only begin to debit your account once you have authorised the PayTo Payment Agreement via your ANZ banking channel.
Any personal information you provide to the merchant (payee) will be subject to the merchant’s (payee’s) Privacy Policy and terms and conditions.
What if a payment is taken outside of the terms of my PayTo agreement?
If you have a PayTo Payment Agreement with a merchant (payee) who has taken a payment that you believe to be outside of the terms of the agreement, you should contact the business to rectify it.
If you are unable to contact the merchant (payee) to resolve the matter, please contact ANZ.
If you believe that the payment may be fraudulent, pause your agreement to ensure no further debits can be deducted from your account and immediately contact ANZ by sending us a message in the ANZ App. Tap Support to get started.
For more information, please refer to your product Terms and Conditions.
Can I change my account from a BSB and Account number to a PayID?
Once a PayTo Payment Agreement is created using a BSB and account number, you are unable to change it to a PayID.
If you would like to use a PayID on your PayTo Payment Agreement, the merchant (payee) will need to set up a new PayTo agreement using your PayID.
Will a PayTo payment impact my bonus interest?
If your account offers bonus interest on the condition that there are not any withdrawals made within the month, any PayTo payments debited from your account are classified as a transaction and will impact you receiving your bonus interest for the month.
